# Code Buddy v2

A compact, AI-powered coding assistant that helps learners and developers convert pseudocode into working code, enhance messy code, solve DSA problems with structured explanations, and run & test code right inside the browser.  
Think of it as a developer‚Äôs pocket tool ‚Äî teaching, polishing, and validating code in a single place.

## Key features
- üöÄ **DSA Solver** - Paste a problem URL (LeetCode / GfG etc.) and get a structured solution: explanation, data structures used, optimized code, dry run, and complexity analysis.  
- üß© **Pseudo ‚Üí Code Translator** - Convert informal pseudocode or algorithmic descriptions into runnable code in the language of your choice.  
- ‚ú® **Code Enhancer** - Improve readability, add subtle comments, fix naming, reduce duplication, and optimize performance.  
- üíª **In-built Code Editor & Runner** - Edit and run generated code directly in the app using the Monaco editor + remote execution engine (Piston/Judge0).  
- üîê **Safe API proxying** - AI requests are proxied through a backend (AWS Lambda) so the OpenAI key is not exposed in the browser.  
- üß™ **Test-friendly workflow** - Jump from generated output to a test playground (modify inputs, run cases, copy results).
- üê≥ **Dockerized** - The app is dockerized to run in any machine via containers

## Tech stack
- **Frontend:** React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, React Router, Monaco Editor (code editing experience)  
- **Backend / API proxy:** Node.js (AWS Lambda) ‚Äî proxies prompts to OpenAI models to keep keys secure  
- **AI:** OpenAI models (e.g. `gpt-4.1-mini`) for code generation, enhancement and translation  
- **Code execution:** Piston / (remote execution API) to compile/run multiple languages safely  
- **Deployment & Hosting:**  
  - Vercel (frontend)  
  - AWS Lambda (backend API proxy)  
  - **Docker** ‚Äî containerized version of the app for consistent environment setup & portability  
- **Languages supported (examples):** Python, JavaScript, Java, C++ (scalable)
